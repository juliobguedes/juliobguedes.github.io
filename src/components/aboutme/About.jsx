            I am a brazilian developer and undergraduate student in Computer
            Science at the Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG), currently
            on the sixth semester.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently working in the Computational Perception Laboratory (LPC) @ UFCG,
            under advisement of professors Herman Martins and Eanes Torres, in a project using
            React Native and Node.js.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also like to keep myself learning what I can, improving existing skills and
            always challenging myself. I also like to participate in coding competitions with
            my friends, watch a lot of movies and series and read.
