        <p>
            I am a brazilian undergraduate student and Master&apos;s candidate
            in Computer Science at the Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG).
            I am currently working with Natural Language Processing (NLP) in a
            project in partnership with Dell EMC, and researching in Recommender Systems.

            During my undergraduate course I have worked with both Web and Mobile development,
            using Angular.JS and React Native. I am now focusing in Data Analysis and
            Visualization, and Machine Learning with a special interest in Deep Learning topics.
