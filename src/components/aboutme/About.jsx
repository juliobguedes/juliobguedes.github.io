            I am a brazilian undergraduate student and Master&apos;s candidate
            in Computer Science at the Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG).
            I am currently developing in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
            in a project in partnership with Dell EMC, and researching in Recommender Systems
            and related topics.

            During my undergraduate course I have worked with both Web and Mobile development, using
            Angular.JS and React Native respectively. I am now focused in Data Analysis and
            Visualization, and Machine Learning with a special interest in Deep Learning.
