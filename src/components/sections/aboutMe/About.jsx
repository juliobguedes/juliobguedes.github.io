            I am a brazilian Master&apos;s candidate in Computer Science
            at the Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG), currently
            researching about Recommender Systems.

            In the past I worked with both Web and Mobile development, using frameworks
            like Angular and React. I am now working in Data-related projects, focusing
            in Data Analysis and Visualization, and Machine Learning with a special
            interest in Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning topics.
